# Description
ScanSafe is an application that allows people to scan the barcode of a food item and discover if that item has any potentially harmful ingredients. The purpose of the app is to help people make healthy choices when grocery shopping all while allowing people to shop at the grocery store of their choice. A great feature of the app is the ability for users to create a list of ingredients they personally want to avoid. The application will also have a special superuser called an “influencer” who can propose to add ingredients to the harmful list as well as allow them to make curated lists of products for other users to enjoy.
